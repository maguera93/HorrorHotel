# HorrorHotel
A PSX game made with PSY-Q

This project was more focused as an C retro engine than a game project itself. It's a Resident Evil clone without enemies, only focused on the inventory and in puzzle solving. The important parts was the memory management of the game, the load and unload of assets and in the posibility of make it expandable.

It was a great experience, hope anyone who wants to make thier own PSX game might find this code usefull.
